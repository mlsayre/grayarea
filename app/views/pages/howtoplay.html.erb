		Welcome to Word Stretch, the word association game that helps you stretch your mind as you stretch your words!<br><br>
		<a href="#giver" class="htpgive">Playing as Giver</a>
		<a href="#guesser" class="htpguess">Playing as Guesser</a><br><br>

		<span class="centered" style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">The Basics</span><br><br>
		A 15-word board is randomly created out of over 700 words. <b>Six</b> of those words are the target words. <b>One</b> of the words is the <span style="color: red;">spoiler</span>.<br><br>
		It's up to the hint giver to help the guesser choose the six target words while avoiding neutral words (especially avoiding the <span style="color: red;">spoiler</span>!).<br><br>
		The hint giver will give the guesser 2 <b>one word</b> hints. It's up to the hint giver to come up with words that apply to as many of the target words as possible while avoiding the other words.<br><br>
		Once the guesser has finished, the game is scored - both players receiving the same score. It's a team effort!<br><br>
		<span id="giver" class="centered" style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Playing as the Hint Giver</span><br><br>
		To begin, analyze the board carefully. Look for anything that ties as many of the target (green) words together while not applying to the non-target words. Be especially careful to avoid words that may suggest the <span style="color: red;">spoiler</span>!<br><br>
		Enter your <b>one word</b> first hint and click the number of words that hint applies to. That number is very helpful for the guesser to see how far they may have to "stretch" your hint word. Submit that word, then do the same thing for your second hint.<br><br> 
		Then, sit and wait for the guessers to join your game! Each game can have up to six guessers.<br><br>
		You'll notice the chat button will appear in the upper right once you've submitted your two hints. You can preemptively apologize for your lousy hints before anybody else plays your game, or claim your brilliance at finding a word which applied to five of the target words. It's fun to chat and help people see what you were thinking and hear how they perceived the hints.<br><br> 

		<span id="guesser" class="centered" style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Playing as a Guesser</span><br><br>
		To begin, look at the first hint word and see how many possible words that hint could apply to. Also consider the number of words the hint giver has said the word applies to. If you see three possible words, but the number is two, then start ranking the possibilities in terms of how powerful a connection there is.<br><br>
		Then, simply click to select a word. You will be asked to click again to confirm. One of three things will happen:<br><br>
		1. Correct! You can guess another word, or move on to the second hint word if you've found all the first hint's words. If it's the last of the second hint's words and you haven't found all six words yet, you can select a <b>bonus</b> word if you missed one of the first hint's words. <br>
		2. Almost! You selected a word that isn't one of the targets, but luckily is also not the <span style="color: red;">spoiler</span>. If this comes during the first hint, you move on to the second hint. If it comes during the second hint, you still get to try for a bonus word!<br>
		3. <span style="color: red;">Spoiler!</span> The game immediately ends and you and the hint giver receive no points for the game. Most unfortunate!!<br><br>
		After you finish guessing, you will notice the chat button appears in the upper right. This is your chance to commiserate with other guessers, brag about your brilliance, berate the hint giver, or even compliment the hint giver for their brilliant clues. It's fun to get a little window into what other players are thinking. It might even help you in future games...<br><br> 
		<span class="centered" style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Scoring</span><br><br>
		The scoring is as follows:<br>
		0 words: 0 points<br>
		1 word : 10 points<br>
		2 words: 20 points<br>
		3 words: 35 points<br>
		4 words: 50 points<br>
		5 words: 70 points<br>
		6 words: 100 points<br><br>
		You may notice the words get more valuable as each one is guessed. Getting six words will be a very rare thing! Getting four will likely be about average. There's usually a way to make at least a couple of pairs of target words in each game.<br><br>
		And there you have it! Enjoy the game, and if you have any comment or suggestions, please email me at matt@wordstretch.com . Thanks for playing!<br><br>
